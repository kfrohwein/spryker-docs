This document describes how to install Spryker in [Development Mode](/docs/scos/dev/setup/installing-spryker-with-docker/installation-guides/choosing-an-installation-mode.html#development-mode) on Windows.

## Installing Docker prerequisites on Windows

To install Docker prerequisites on Windows with WSL1, follow [Installing Docker prerequisites on Windows with WSL1](/docs/scos/dev/setup/installing-spryker-with-docker/docker-installation-prerequisites/installing-docker-prerequisites-on-windows-with-wsl1.html).

To install Docker prerequisites on Windows with WSL2, follow [Installing Docker prerequisites on Windows with WSL2](/docs/scos/dev/setup/installing-spryker-with-docker/docker-installation-prerequisites/installing-docker-prerequisites-on-windows-with-wsl2.html).


## Installing Spryker in Development mode on Windows

Follow the steps to install Spryker in Development mode:

1. Open Ubuntu.
2. Open a terminal.
3. Create a new folder and navigate into it.

    {% info_block warningBox "Important" %}

    Avoid using folders that are under a Windows filesystem, because it will slow down all operations significantly (the reason is because Ubuntu <-> Windows filesystem sync).

    Wrong: /mnt/c/Users/jdoe/Desktop/project

    Correct: /home/jdoe/workspace/project

    {% endinfo_block %}

4. Depending on the desired [Demo Shop](/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/intro-to-spryker.html#spryker-b2bb2c-demo-shops):

    * Clone the B2C repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2c-demo-shop.git -b 202212.0-p2 --single-branch ./b2c-demo-shop
    ```

    * Clone the B2B repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2b-demo-shop.git -b 202212.0-p2 --single-branch ./b2b-demo-shop
    ```

5. Depending on the repository you've cloned, navigate into the cloned folder:

    * B2C repository:

    ```bash
    cd b2c-demo-shop
    ```

    * B2B repository:

    ```bash
    cd b2b-demo-shop
    ```

{% info_block warningBox "Verification" %}

Make sure that you are in the correct folder by running the `pwd` command.

{% endinfo_block %}

6. Clone the Docker SDK repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spryker/docker-sdk.git --single-branch docker
```

7. In `{shop_name}/docker/context/php/debug/etc/php/debug.conf.d/69-xdebug.ini`, set `xdebug.remote_host` and `xdebug.client_host` to `host.docker.internal`:

```text
...
xdebug.remote_host=host.docker.internal
...
xdebug.client_host=host.docker.internal
```

8. Add your user to the `docker` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

9. Bootstrap local docker setup:

```bash
docker/sdk bootstrap deploy.dev.yml
```

{% info_block infoBox "Bootstrap" %}

Once you finish the setup, you don't need to run `bootstrap` to start the instance. You only need to run it after the following takes place:

* Docker SDK version update.
* Deploy file update.

{% endinfo_block %}

10. Update the `hosts` file:
    1. Open the Start menu.
    2. In the search field, enter `Notepad`.
    3. Right-click *Notepad* and select **Run as administrator**.
    4. In the *User Account Control* window, select **Yes** to confirm the action.
    5. In the upper navigation panel, select **File** > **Open**.
    6. Put the following path into the address line: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`.
    7. In the **File name** line, enter `hosts` and select **Open**.
    The hosts file opens in the drop-down.
    8. Follow the installation instructions in the white box from the `docker/sdk bootstrap` command execution results to prepare the environment.

    {% info_block warningBox "Warning" %}

    *It is not recommended to exceed 10 hostnames per line* on Windows machines. Split a long line into multiple lines if necessary.

    {% endinfo_block %}

    {% info_block infoBox %}

    To get the list of instructions, you can run `docker/sdk install` after `bootstrap`.

    {% endinfo_block %}

    9. Select **File > Save**.
    10. Close the file.

11. Once the job finishes, build and start the instance:

```bash
docker/sdk up
```

{% info_block infoBox %}

Depending on the hardware performance, the first project launch can take up to 20 minutes.

{% endinfo_block %}

## Endpoints

To ensure that the installation is successful, make sure you can access the configured endpoints from the Deploy file. For more information about the Deploy file, see [Deploy file reference - 1.0](/docs/scos/dev/the-docker-sdk/{{site.version}}/deploy-file/deploy-file-reference-1.0.html).

{% info_block infoBox "RabbitMQ UI credentials" %}

To access RabbitMQ UI, use `spryker` as a username and `secret` as a password. You can adjust the credentials in `deploy.yml`.

{% endinfo_block %}

## Getting the list of useful commands

To get the full and up-to-date list of commands, run `docker/sdk help`.
