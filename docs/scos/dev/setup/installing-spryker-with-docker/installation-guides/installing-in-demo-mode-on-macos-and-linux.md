{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}

Starting with the 202204.0 release, the following guide applies to both Intel and ARM architectures. You can install the demo shops of previous versions on ARM chips by following the steps from the [Switch to ARM architecture](/docs/scos/dev/technical-enhancement-integration-guides/switch-to-arm-architecture-m1-chip.html) technical enhancement guide.

{% endinfo_block %}


This document describes the procedure of installing Spryker in [Demo Mode](/docs/scos/dev/setup/installing-spryker-with-docker/installation-guides/choosing-an-installation-mode.html#demo-mode) on MacOS and Linux.

## Install Docker prerequisites on MacOS and Linux

To install Docker prerequisites, follow one of the guides:

* [Installing Docker prerequisites on MacOS](/docs/scos/dev/setup/installing-spryker-with-docker/docker-installation-prerequisites/installing-docker-prerequisites-on-macos.html)
* [Installing Docker prerequisites on Linux](/docs/scos/dev/setup/installing-spryker-with-docker/docker-installation-prerequisites/installing-docker-prerequisites-on-linux.html)

## Clone a Demo Shop and the Docker SDK

1. Open a terminal.
2. Create a new folder and navigate into it.
3. Depending on the desired [Demo Shop](/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/intro-to-spryker.html#spryker-b2bb2c-demo-shops):

    * Clone the B2C repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2c-demo-shop.git -b 202212.0-p2 --single-branch ./b2c-demo-shop
    ```

    * Clone the B2B repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2b-demo-shop.git -b 202212.0-p2 --single-branch ./b2b-demo-shop
    ```
4. Depending on the cloned repository, navigate into the cloned folder:

    * B2C repository:

    ```bash
    cd b2c-demo-shop
    ```

    * B2B repository:

    ```bash
    cd b2b-demo-shop
    ```

{% info_block warningBox "Verification" %}

Make sure that you are in the correct folder by running the `pwd` command.

{% endinfo_block %}

5. Clone the Docker SDK repository into the same folder:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/spryker/docker-sdk.git --single-branch docker
```

## Configure and start the instance


1. Bootstrap the local Docker setup for demo:

```shell
docker/sdk bootstrap
```

{% info_block warningBox "Bootstrap" %}

Once you finish the setup, you don't need to run `bootstrap` to start the instance. You only need to run it after:

* Docker SDK version update.
* Deploy file update.

{% endinfo_block %}

2. Once the job finishes, build and start the instance:

```shell
docker/sdk up
```

3. Update the `hosts` file:

Follow the installation instructions in the white box from the `docker/sdk bootstrap` command execution results to prepare the environment.

{% info_block infoBox %}

To get the list of the instructions, you can run `docker/sdk install` after `bootstrap`.

{% endinfo_block %}

{% info_block warningBox %}

Depending on the hardware performance, the first project launch can take up to *20 minutes*.

{% endinfo_block %}

## Endpoints

To ensure that the installation is successful, make sure you can access the configured endpoints from the Deploy file. For more information about the Deploy file, see [Deploy file reference - 1.0](/docs/scos/dev/the-docker-sdk/{{site.version}}/deploy-file/deploy-file-reference-1.0.html).

### Back-Office

The default credentials to access the Back Office are located inside `/src/Pyz/Zed/User/UserConfig.php`.

### RabbitMQ

To access RabbitMQ UI, use `spryker` as a username and `secret` as a password. You can adjust the credentials in `deploy.yml`. For information about the Deploy file, see [Deploy file reference - 1.0](/docs/scos/dev/the-docker-sdk/{{site.version}}/deploy-file/deploy-file-reference-1.0.html).

## Getting the list of useful commands

To get the full and up-to-date list of commands, run `docker/sdk help`.
